    <p>Fried chicken is a beloved dish known for its crispy, golden-brown crust and tender, juicy meat. 
    The key to a great fried chicken recipes lies in seasoning, marinating, and the frying technique. 
    Start by choosing bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces like thighs, drumsticks or breasts, as the bones 
    and skin help keep the meat moist and flavourful. A buttermilk marinade is a classic choice because 
    its acidity helps tenderise the chicken while adding tanginess. Season the marinade generously with 
    salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and any other favourite spices.</p>

    <p>For the coating, mix flour with a blend of seasonings such a cayenne, garlic powder, smoked paprika,
    salt, and black pepper for extra flavour. After marinating, dredge each piece of chicken in the seasoned
    flour, pressing it firmly to create a thick, even coating. To ensure extra crispiness, some people double
    dip the chicken by first dreding it in flour, then dipping it in a buttermilk or an egg wash, and finally
    coating it with flour again. Fry the chicken in hot oil (around 175C) until it reaches an internal temperature
    of 75C, turning occasionally for an even golden crust. Let the fried chicken rest on a wire rack to drain
    excess oil, ensuring it stays crispy. The result is succulent, flavourful chicken with a perfectly crunchy
    exterior.</p>
