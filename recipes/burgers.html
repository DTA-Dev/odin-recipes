    <p>A bacon cheeseburger is a deliciously indulgent twist on the classic cheeseburger. It starts with a juicy, 
    perfectly seasoned beef patty, often made from ground chuck for its rich flavor and ideal fat content. 
    The patty is grilled or pan-fried to achieve a mouthwatering char on the outside while remaining tender and 
    juicy on the inside.</p>

    <p>The burger is typically assembled on a toasted bun, which adds a slight crispiness and helps hold all the 
    delicious components together. Fresh toppings like crisp lettuce, ripe tomato slices, and tangy pickles are 
    often added for extra texture and flavor. A dollop of your favorite condiments, such as ketchup, mustard, or 
    a special burger sauce, completes this mouthwatering creation.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef (preferably ground chuck)</li>
        <li>4 slices cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>8 strips bacon</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>4 leaves lettuce</li>
        <li>8 pickle slices</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons mustard</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons burger sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to Cook:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Season the ground beef with salt and pepper, then divide it into 4 equal portions. Shape each portion into a patty, about Â¾ inch thick.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon strips until crispy, about 4-5 minutes per side. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined
        plate to drain excess grease.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet or on a grill, cook the beef patties over medium-high heat. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side for medium doneness, 
        or until they reach your desired level of doneness.</li>
        <li>During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheddar cheese on each patty and cover the skillet or close the grill lid to melt the cheese.</li>
        <li>While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burgers!</li>
    </ol>
