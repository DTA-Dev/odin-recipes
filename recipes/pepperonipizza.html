    <p>Pepperoni pizza is a classic favorite, known for its crispy crust, tangy tomato sauce, gooey mozzarella cheese, 
    and generous slices of spicy pepperoni. The pepperoni slices curl up and crisp at the edges when baked, adding a 
    delightful texture and a burst of flavor with each bite. This pizza is perfect for a quick weeknight dinner or a 
    fun weekend treat.</p>

        <li>1½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>175ml (6 fl oz) warm water</li>
        <li>3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for greasing</li>
        <li>100ml (3½ fl oz) passata (tomato sauce)</li>
        <li>200g (7 oz) pepperoni, sliced into rounds</li>
        <li>200g (7 oz) mozzarella, broken into pieces or sliced</li>
        <li>A few sprigs of fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to Cook:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 240°C (220°C Fan) or Gas Mark 9.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, yeast, and salt.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the center and pour in the warm water and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Mix with a wooden spoon, then use your hands to form a soft ball of dough.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and springy.</li>
        <li>Dust the work surface with flour and roll out the dough into a large, thin disc.</li>
        <li>Press your fingertips into the dough all over to prevent it from rising too much during baking.</li>
        <li>Spread the passata over the pizza base, leaving a small border around the edge.</li> 
        <li>Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Scatter the pepperoni slices and mozzarella pieces evenly over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is crisp and the cheese is bubbling and starting to brown.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil over the pizza.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves and a final grind of black pepper.</li>
        <li>Slice and enjoy your homemade pepperoni pizza!</li>
